            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Nicholas Pavey. I am a 3rd year student at UC for IT: Software Development.</br>
                I have been developing personally and for classes for almost 6 years. I have worked mainly with C# and Java</br>
                for work/school purposes, and with probably a dozen other languages/frameworks on my own personal projects.</br>
                </br>
                I dont currently play a lot of games, but occasionally I will play Rainbow Six Siege as I'd say it is probably my favorite game currently.</br>
                I used to play/work with Minecraft plugin development years ago, and I think that is what got me started working with Java.</br>
                Im excited for the eventual release of Halo for PC.</br>
                
            </p>
